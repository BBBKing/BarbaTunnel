In Windows Server 2008 (non R2) you should download and install the following patch from Microsoft:
[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2761494](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2761494)

This package should be installed by automatic update too, but if you disable automatic update then you should install it manually otherwise WinDivert may not work!
